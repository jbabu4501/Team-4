# SleepWare (Team 4)
Alarm App that can be branched to different solutions of waking up a user other than just the alarm noise/alert.
Problem: Deep sleepers struggle to find realistic solutions to being woken up, what will a person do if they left there silent mode on, or have no one there to wake them up.
Our thoughts of solutions: 
1) Smart watch buzzing(alarm action) - This factor we wanted to integerate technology already incorporated on a smart watch such as alarm buzzing, but our uniqueness comes to detecting the amount of motion during sleep. After utilizing this data the app (mobile or smart watch) will determine proper times to begin waking a person up during sleep according to the regular rem cycle. 
2) Bluetooth connectivity(Smart home features) - This factor we wanted to keep adding enough features to guarantee someone has woken-up. SO to dig deeper, smart homes, smart light bulbs, smart blinds are innovating everyday so integretting a set time to turn the lights on, or open the blinds can hopefully give more oppurtunites to wake up on time.
